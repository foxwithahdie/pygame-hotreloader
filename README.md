# pygame-hotreloader

A hotreloader for Pygame.

This will be a tool used for Pygame developers to be able to hotreload their game.

## v0.0.1:

### Plans:

- Will keep the main screen available, but the things shown will change. Will display a refresh icon OR will allow for refresh via keybind.
- If there is an error, will either show a red screen displaying the exception OR will crash the program.
- Refresh icon will fade after refresh
- Allow for ability to set it to automatically refresh or manually refresh via keybind
- Runs when a file is changed in all packages in a folder
- Fast
